## Game Description
Synopsis:

The Tinys were a hidden race trialed by war between two of its races. Due to food and supplies shortages burdened by the prolonged war, the chief of each race sent out a hero to enter the giantâ€™s lair to gather supplies. And thus the race began where you role play as the hero to gather supplies in this scavenger hunt multi-player game.

Objective:

Each Player needs to find and deposit 3 items in order to win the game. Players can use their skills selected at the start of the game to aid themselves or hinder their opponents. Look out for the timer that will appear on the top of the screen and go to any Red Safe Zone before the counter reaches 0 to avoid being spotted by the evil giant and getting killed instantly. The basic UI are summarized in the picture below.
